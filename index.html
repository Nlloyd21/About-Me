    <h2>Noah Lloyd</h2>
    <p> Well hello there. Let me quickly introduce myself. 
        My name is Noah Lloyd, I am from the small town of Pelham in the tiny state New Hampshire, and this is my first semster here at BYUI.
        I orginally lived in Illinois for my entire life until my senior year of high school where we moved out to New England. 
        I am the thrid out of four kids. 
    </p>
    <p>Some of my favorite hobbies are photography, making videos, and overall just hanging out and doing
        stupid stuff with my best friend, who is also my roomate. We both share the same interest of cars and music. 
        One of our favorite thing to do is to just drive around for hours, getting some food, all while listening 
        to some of our favorite music. 
    </p>
